# Koder

[![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Koder is a local-first remote client for [Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/). The long-term product direction is **web-first**: the active client rewrite lives in [`web/`](web/), while the Node bridge and relay continue to be the operational core that talks to your local Codex runtime.

## Status

Be precise about the current state:

- `web/` is the new primary direction and now works as the self-hosted React + Vite + TypeScript PWA client.
- `phodex-bridge/` and `relay/` are the working backend pieces that drive session routing and the local Codex bridge.

That means Koder is now **web-first in both roadmap and active self-hosted usage**.

## Product Model

Koder is now a single path:

Rules:

- self-hosted bridge, relay, and web client are the product
- the project is 100% free to use in self-hosted mode
- there is no hosted paid tier in the current direction
- keep the relay as transport, not a hosted control plane

See [Docs/KODER_PRODUCT_SPEC.md](Docs/KODER_PRODUCT_SPEC.md) for the current working direction.

├── web/             React + Vite + TypeScript PWA client

## Quick Start

### Source Checkout

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arwebSE/koder.git
cd koder
./start.sh --ip 192.168.1.10
```

That starts:

- a local relay
- the local bridge
- the local web client on port `5173`
- direct self-host browser access on the same host or IP

Open the printed browser URL on your phone over HTTPS. The launcher serves the PWA on a secure origin and exposes a matching `wss://.../relay` URL through that same origin. The browser attaches directly to the live self-hosted bridge on that host.

### npm Bridge Install

The package is still published under `remodex` during the transition, but it exposes a `koder` command alias.

```sh
npm install -g remodex@latest
koder up
```

The legacy CLI alias still works too.

                                           └─────────────┘
```

Core properties:

- Codex runs on the user's machine
- git and workspace operations run on the user's machine
- the relay is a transport layer, not the runtime
- session transport is designed for self-hosting

## Commands

The preferred CLI name is `koder`.

- `koder up`
  Starts the bridge. On macOS it uses the background service path; on other platforms it runs in the foreground.
- `koder run`
  Runs the bridge in the foreground.
- `koder start`
  macOS only. Starts the background bridge service without waiting for interactive terminal output.
- `koder restart`
  macOS only. Restarts the background bridge service.
- `koder stop`
  macOS only. Stops the background bridge service.
- `koder status`
  macOS only. Prints service and pairing status.
- `koder run-service`
  macOS only. Internal `launchd` service entrypoint.
- `koder reset-pairing`
  Clears saved trust state so the next connection requires a fresh bootstrap.
- `koder resume`
  Reopens the last active thread in `Codex.app`.
- `koder watch [threadId]`
  Tails a thread rollout in real time.
- `koder --version`
  Prints the installed bridge version.

## Environment

Important variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `REMODEX_RELAY` | Relay URL for bridge session routing |
| `REMODEX_ADVERTISED_RELAY` | Relay URL advertised to clients when the bridge connects on a different local socket |
| `REMODEX_PUSH_SERVICE_URL` | Optional push HTTP base URL |
| `REMODEX_CODEX_ENDPOINT` | Connect to an existing Codex WebSocket instead of spawning `codex app-server` |
| `REMODEX_REFRESH_ENABLED` | Enables the desktop refresh workaround |
| `REMODEX_REFRESH_DEBOUNCE_MS` | Debounce window for refresh events |
| `REMODEX_REFRESH_COMMAND` | Custom refresh command |
| `REMODEX_CODEX_BUNDLE_ID` | Bundle ID for the Codex desktop app |
| `CODEX_HOME` | Codex data directory |

Examples:

```sh
# Self-hosted relay
REMODEX_RELAY="ws://localhost:9000/relay" koder up

# Existing Codex instance
REMODEX_CODEX_ENDPOINT="ws://localhost:8080" koder up

# Desktop refresh workaround
REMODEX_REFRESH_ENABLED=true koder up
```

## Security Notes

- Koder is local-first: runtime, git, and workspace operations stay on the user's machine.
- The relay code is public and self-hostable.
- The transport is designed so the relay does not need plaintext application payloads after the secure session is established.
- Avoid hardcoding hosted domains into the open-source path.
- For the tightest trust model, run the relay yourself.

## Self-Hosting

For the full self-hosting flow, see [Docs/self-hosting.md](Docs/self-hosting.md).

The short version:

1. run your own relay
2. point the bridge at it with `REMODEX_RELAY`
3. keep hosted assumptions out of the OSS path

## Contributing

This repo is still in active transition. Keep changes pragmatic:

- preserve self-hosted behavior
- keep docs honest about what is working today
- avoid reintroducing hardcoded hosted-service assumptions
